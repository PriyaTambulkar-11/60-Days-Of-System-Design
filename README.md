# 60 Days of System Design 🏗️

Welcome to my **60 Days of System Design** learning journey!  
This repository documents my day-by-day progress as I dive deep into the fundamentals and advanced topics of system design, 
networking, backend, frontend performance, databases, caching, scalability, and more.

---

## 📅 Structure

The journey is broken into 60 days, each focusing on a specific topic, with notes, diagrams, and examples (especially in Java). The goals are:

- Master system design fundamentals from scratch.
- Build real-world understanding using analogies and Java-based examples.
- Improve interview preparation and architecture decision-making skills.
